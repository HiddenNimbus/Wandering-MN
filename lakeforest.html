    <h2>Congrats!</h2>
    <p>Moved back to Forest Lake and man did things change, or rather my perspective did.<br />
       The place was weird Their idea of black folks was highly uninformed. My time here was mainly bitter sweet at best.<br />
       The place I spent the longest was a place me as young black teen adult couldn't find comfort in only the memories.<br />
       Eventually those too would turn sour after conversations with many from when I was younger.<br />
