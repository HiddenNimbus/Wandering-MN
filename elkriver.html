    <h2>Congrat!</h2>
    <p>Moved to Elk river 2018 right After graduating college, can't lie didn't like the area very much not many poc in sight.<br />
        Worked at a Nike a couple towns over.The outlet mall was cool but Covid quickly killed the vibe there.<br />
        Eventually got tired of that and worked at a Liquor store but that got.... depressing.<br />
        Eventually I found a skatepark and thats been very theraputic not much else to really do physically here wanywa.<br />
        There's a train to the cities but it only shows up earlier than college students when they here free food and comes back before 6!<br />
        6 Seriously?Why Does everything close early still?
